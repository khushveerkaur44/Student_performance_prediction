# Student Performance Prediction Using Linear Regression

# Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting student academic performance using a Linear Regression model. By analyzing factors such as study hours, attendance, previous scores, and related features, the model estimates the final performance of students. The goal is to demonstrate how basic machine-learning techniques can help identify patterns and support early academic interventions.

# Objectives

1.Analyze key factors affecting student performance

2.Build a prediction model using Linear Regression

3.Evaluate model accuracy and performance

4.Demonstrate practical application of simple ML techniqu

# Methodology

1. Data Collection & Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Selection
4. Linear Regression Model Training
5. Model Evaluation (MAE, MSE, R² Score)
6. Prediction & Result Interpretation

# Model Used

Linear Regression — chosen for its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness for continuous output prediction.

# Technologies Used

Python
Google Colab
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib 
Seaborn

# Results

The model successfully predicts student performance with reasonable accuracy, highlighting strong relationships between study habits, attendance, and academic outcomes.
